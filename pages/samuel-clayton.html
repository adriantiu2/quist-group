      <p class="text-block">Samuel Clayton<br>
        <br>Samuel Clayton is an artist and designer whose work explores the intersection of function and form, creating objects that feel both familiar and intimate. Working primarily in wood, he uses the material as a way to examine the emotional weight embedded in everyday objects. Through his practice, utilitarian items are reimagined as sculptural forms.At the core of Clayton’s work is an exploration of fragility, drawing on religious and philosophical ideas about materiality, presence, and the human experience. His pieces, often suggestive of bodies or motion, evoke a tension between stability and vulnerability. Through subtle shifts in form and material, his work points to the quiet, often unnoticed connections we have with the objects that shape our lives.
