        <br>Emily began her BFA studies in 2018 at Rhode Island School of Design, double majoring in Painting and Jewelry and Metalsmithing. Her interest in working in both two and three dimensionally motivated a desire to challenge both ways of thinking and making, allowing her to engage with the varied philosophies of two creative fields of study. Working across and between cerebral and tactile realms she is able to expand. and enrich her creative output. Currently, her practice is focused on building a space where her two practices can co-exist and stimulate further cross disciplinary exploration.</p>
