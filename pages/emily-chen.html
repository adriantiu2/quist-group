      <p class="text-block">Emily Chen<br>
        <br>Emily Chen is an artist whose practice explores the intersection of image, object, and form, particularly through her recent series of wooden wall sculptures that function as both paintings and sculptures. Paired with flatware objects, these works provoke ideas of meals and daily rituals while challenging the utility of familiar objects. Through this fusion, Chen investigates how we perceive and relate to the objects around us, blurring the lines between art, function, and meaning.
        Her work is deeply informed by geometry, with recurring spherical forms functioning as symbols of boundaries, light, and energy. In Chen’s paintings, light becomes a generative force that breaks these boundaries, reimagining space and form. This exploration of spherical motifs reflects her ongoing speculation on the nature of existence—an emotional meditation on new beginnings and endings.
